		"text": "My story you can't find in a textbook. It is very different from most other people. If you can give me a \"real\" challenge and tell me it's impossible or too hard to solve, you know how to keep a guy like me interested. With a vast knowledge about \"how shit works\" and a deep low to high level competence in IT, I am the \"Swiss Army Knife\" for your needs.<br/><br/>If you have read so far, you might be interested in who I am and what I can do. If so, you should know that I am always open to new possibilities or at least a good conversation. Meeting new people and learning new things always makes me smile."
